Project Proposal: Personalized News Aggregator

1. Idea
Create a Python-powered application that collects news articles from various sources online and delivers personalized recommendations to users based on their interests.
- MVP: Aggregate headlines and articles from selected news APIs like, NewsAPI, NYTimes, BBC and offer keyword search, and provide a summary of top stories.
- Stretch Goal: Implement natural language processing (NLP) to analyze article sentiment, categorize news, and automatically summarize content.

2. Learning Objectives
- Team Goals: Gain hands-on experience working with APIs, data processing, and software design. On top be able to implmenent Agile project management.
- Individual Goals: (List 1-2 goals per member, e.g., improving API integration, practicing front-end development with Flask or Streamlit, learning NLP basics.)

3. Implementation Plan
- Use Python for backend logic and data collection.
- Integrate public news APIs with the requests library.
- Be able to store user preferences and reading history in a local file or database.
- Display results using a simple web interface.

4. Project Schedule
| Week 0 | Milestone/Objective                         
| Week 1 | Set up repo, choose APIs, prototype search  
| Week 2 | Basic news aggregation and display          
| Week 3 | Add user preferences, keyword filters, Polish 

5.  Plan
- Make sure each week I am keeping up with my objectives for the week

6. Risks and Limitations
- API rate limits or data access restrictions.
- Unfamiliar libraries/technologies and potential integration issues.
- Time management for stretch features.

7. Additional Course Content
- Error Handling
- API Testing
